            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>I am currently pursuing my B.A., LL.B (Hons) at GITAM University, a NAAC A++ rated institution. My academic trajectory has been unique, shaped by opportunities that have honed my skills and understanding of legal theory and practice.</p>
            <p>Beginning my legal education at GITAM in 2017, I aimed to gain a strong theoretical foundation. With an aspiration for further growth, I attended GLC, Bombay, Asia's oldest law college, followed by KLE Society's Law College in Bengaluru. My experiences there enriched my understanding of practical legal aspects but I felt a stronger pull towards a more balanced mix of theory and practice. Consequently, I found myself back at GITAM, completing my final years.</p>
            <p>Throughout this journey, my interest in Technology and IP Law was kindled and nurtured. I delved into understanding the complexities of this field through various workshops, debates, internships, and freelance work. For instance, my work on Blockchain, Digital Assets and International Arbitration gave me valuable insights into the intersection of law and technology. My participation in Hackathons, such as the National TEQIP Hackathon where I headed legal and compliance research, further fueled this interest.</p>
            <p>In collaboration with various organizations and teams, I have contributed to policy ideation, legal research, and strategy formulation. My legal internships, most notably with Permissionless and my current role at DentalQ, have provided me with firsthand experience in dealing with the legal and compliance challenges in the tech industry.</p>
            <p>As the Co-founder and Head of Legal at Tripleths ENS DAO, I am constantly exploring the legal and intellectual property landscapes of digital assets. My involvement in freelancing has also given me a platform to create high-impact content for major corporates like Koch Business Solutions and VISA.</p>
            <p>My journey has been far from conventional, but it has been purposeful. It is this purpose that drives me to strive for a Masters in Technology and IP Law from a leading European institution. I am excited about the possibilities this academic pursuit would open up, allowing me to contribute significantly to the evolving legal landscape in the era of digitalization.</p>
