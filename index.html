                <h2>// About Me</h2>
                <p>My academic trajectory converges on the legal aspects of emerging technologies like AI and Blockchain. It has been enriched by my recent role as a Research Scholar at Policy 4.0, a think tank pioneering in emerging technology policy, where I researched global governance frameworks surrounding AI & Blockchain, to provide strategic insights to aid effective policymaking.</p>
                <p>My curiosity and focus extend to AI Safety & Alignment, AI Policy and Liability, which drives me to grasp the regulatory and legal intricacies of these impactful technologies. I'm equally passionate about Enterprise Blockchain Solutions Research and Blockchain Policy Research, making me well-positioned to contribute to the versatile challenges of compliance, policy, and legal research in the emerging tech industry across different verticals.</p>
